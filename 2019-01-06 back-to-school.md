# back to school

feels good to be back in school -- i've been working already since jan 2nd

feels good to be back with all the friends, feels good to be coding again, to have the stress to finish the project before the deadline, aggghh it just feels so good!

not gonna lie -- my one week vacation felt amazing, one week is the right amount for me, i think.
