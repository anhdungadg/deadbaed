# happy new year!

this year i want to start writing here more, because with everything i learn in school, there's gotta be some stuff that would be interesting not only for me, but for some people!

also i still feel like shit since i still feel alone, without a girlfriend :(

people tell me its fine, which i know it is, but deep inside, i feel that loneliness sometimes. thankfully i have wonderful friends, and we are having fun, but sometimes you know....

but i think 2019 will either be a huge success for me, or a complete disaster.  
i have so much to do in so little time, i feel very stressed and anxious, and i think my work is bad when most of the time it isn't -- pressure.

also the last 3 months have been the first where i live alone, and i realize that i'm not organized enough to be fully productive -- this is why in 2019 i will start to follow the 6-2-1 rule for pretty much every day: 6 hours of sleep, 2 meals, 1 shower. i think it may be a good start for the future.

holly shit what a year, can't wait to see what's going to happen next.

i need to thank a shit ton of people for their help for this year, but that will take too much time -- so thank you to everyone who helped me in some part, thank you :)

alright 2019, lets see what you have for us... âš¡
