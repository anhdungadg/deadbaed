# my computer

i never really talked about my computer so lets change that

my computer is a __lenovo thinkpad x1 carbon (3rd generation)__ aka the 2015 version  
the first model appeared in 2012 or some shit like that and it got better and better (afaik the first ones were bad)

so i got the 2015 model, a couple of weeks before the announcement of the 2016 version (i didn't know at the time), and it cost me a __FUCKING _LOT_ OF MONEY__  
the computer itself cost me like __1400€__ and i replaced the ssd (128gb stock) with a 512gb one for __200€__, i did it separately because lenovo would have asked 500€ more if i did it through them.  
so i have a _(almost)_ __1700€__ laptop that is wayy fucking more expensive than it should, and i got mocked a lot cause i don't have a graphics card.

now specs, cause specs fucking matter _right_?  
__cpu__: Intel® Core™ i5-5200U CPU @ 2.20GHz × 4  
__gpu__: Intel® HD Graphics 5500  
__ram__: 8 gigs (non removable)  
__ssd__: 128gb m2 stock (512gb m2 current)  
__display__: 14 inch 1920x1080 good looking display (to me)  
__wifi__: Intel Corporation Wireless 7265  
__bluetooth__: bluetooth 4.0  
__os__: windows 10 home (stock)  
__webcam__: 720p webcam + mic (now covered with tape)  
__battery__: fucking good (like 9/10 hours with vim/chromium on arch, and like 7+ ish hours on windows with softcore work) (not removable)  
__keyboard__: i got mine in qwerty (the keyboard is backlit in 2 modes)  
__trackpad__: pretty good, you even got the trackpoint (the red thing in the middle of the keyboard) and the buttons from the ibm laptops (very useful)  
__fingerprint reader__: almost never use it, useful in bios, works good on windows, bad on arch

pics now! these pics were taken in july 2016, and i was testing ubuntu 16.04 (terrible idea don't do that)
